## Development Setup

### Proxy Configuration
The application uses a proxy configuration to redirect API calls from the Angular dev server (port 4200) to the backend server (port 8080).

- **Proxy File**: `proxy.conf.json`
- **Frontend**: Runs on `http://localhost:4200`
- **Backend**: Runs on `http://localhost:8080`
- **API Calls**: All `/api/*` requests are automatically proxied to the backend

### Running the Application
1. Start the backend server on port 8080
2. Run `ng serve` to start the Angular development server
3. The proxy will automatically redirect API calls to the backend

### Production Deployment
For production, ensure the backend API is accessible at the same domain as the frontend, or update the API base URLs accordingly.
